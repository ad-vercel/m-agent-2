On its own, and with your help, M-Agent has built and now manages a profile of your marketing presence and your business. M-Agent knows enough now to have some opinions on what your marketing priorities are and perhaps should be. At the very least, it knows a good deal about your competitive landscape and positioning, your current presence, and what your competitors are doing. Hopefully you have shared some information about your goals and scale. It will apply some best practices to develop some strategic planning documents from this information. 

As with its profiling process, M-Agent will keep all your data confidential and proprietory to you, and will not use it for training purposes.

What if M-Agent is wrong? Well, just say so. You can ask M-Agent to start over because it got an assumption wrong, or write comments and suggest edits to tweak aspects of its plan. At this point, you may wish to provide M-Agent with a budget and some goals: awareness, engagement, conversion, revenue. 

If you want, M-Agent can allocate your entire budget by audience and channel, with goals. This includes content development, SEO, social media engagement, influencers/PR, CPC, and targeted ads -- suggest other channels and M-Agent will add them to the mix. If you have strong opinions, or already have a strategic plan, share it with M-Agent: M-Agent can make suggestions (if you want them) or start [campaign planning](/feature/author-campaigns).
