Your [campaign planning is now set up in M-agent](/feature/author-campaigns). Now you are ready to start putting them into action. 

This means different things with different channels. 

* For SEO, it's website updates and fixes, content publishing, backlink development. M-Agent helps you by (1) managing a to-do list, which can be published to a project tracking platform or a spreadsheet; and (2) making any updates you allow via API. In any case, M-Agent won't do anything unless you approve it, and will track each task's status on its own.
* For influencers and PR, M-Agent can provide suggestions on whom to engage and how. In the end, you will probably treat these as human tasks, but M-Agent will ask you periodically for updates.
* For digital advertising (SEM, PPC, OTT, retargeting, OTT, etc.), M-Agent can run your campaign according to your own preferred practices. Provide a SOP template, or M-Agent will generate one for you based on your plan. M-Agent will then run your campaigns according to those SOPs, reporting regularly on results, and suggesting changes if things are not working.
* For email and SMS, M-Agent integrates with your management platform at whatever level you prefer, from fully authoring and managing your campaigns to just tracking execution and response.

Once a campaign has started, it's time to [monitor and manage it](/features/monitor-and-manage).
