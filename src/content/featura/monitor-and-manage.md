At this point, with traditional marketing tools, you'd start configuring some reports, to list out your campaigns, compare the effectiveness of different audiences and creative assets, track pacing, evaluate revenue and other business impacts. 

M-Agent already knows all about your campaigns, their goals, and your procedures, so it has some guesses about what you'll be interested in reporting on. So it will configure an initial set of reports for you. And if there is something in particular you would like to see, rather than configuring a report via a set of (fiddly) dropdowns, you can provide directions in natural language, either high-level ("I'd like to compare our top-performing creative for each metro-area segment within campaign (x)") or granular ("Please include a stacked bar chart for comparing keywords and products by revenue for the each week.")

M-Agent integrates with whatever data sources you can provide API access to: Google Analytics, web and E-commerce platforms, CRM and inbound marketing tools. M-Agent creates marketing reports that reflect both the marketing process and the impact on your business. 

As your campaigns progress, M-Agent provides ongoing reporting through the periodic reports and dashboards it has configured. It also takes the initiative to ask: how's it going? A weekly review is an opportunity for it to make suggestions, and to solicit them from you. API issues or other unusual events, such as unexpectedly low or high click rates, automatically generate an alert, with all the relevant details as M-Agent can identify. M-Agent adjusts your campaigns based on any rules you have provided, and provides unlimited opportunities to make your own adjustments.
