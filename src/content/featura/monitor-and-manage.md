M-Agent analyzes your marketing presence across web, social media, and other digital platforms to provide a detailed marketing profile and quickly performs competitive research that would take a human team days or weeks to complete. Give M-Agent feedback on the profile and research to refine the analysis.

M-Agent is... smart. Provide it with your company website, and it reviews it like a good analyst would. It quickly builds a profile of your business:

* How do you present yourself and how do people find you? Your web, social, and search presences.
* What products and services do you offer, how are they priced, and who are your customers?
* Who are your competitors? How strong and well-known are they? Where do you rank for different products, and how are you differentiated?

Based on this profile and M-Agent's proprietary resources, M-Agent provides some general feedback and possible opportunities in the form of a review document. You can mark this up with comments and suggested edits so M-Agent can revise its understanding. Then, do an intake conversation with M-Agent. 

At this point, you may want to share some non-public information, such as revenue or marketing attribution. Whatever you share is yours: 

* M-Agent will not use it for model training or any other internal purpose.
* M-Agent's human staff cannot see it, unless you explictly share it with us.
* It will be fully purged on your request.

With M-Agent, the opportunity for refinement doesn't end with a single intake. M-Agent's UX is _AI-native_, meaning you interact with it similar to how you would an agency or employee:

* Ask M-Agent questions, and it will do the necessary research to answer them, adding the additional information to your profile. 
* M-Agent might have some questions too. For example, it might need to know more about your marketing or other business goals, or past marketing efforts, in order to understand where you are coming from and what you are trying to achieve. It will add this to your profile, and tell you how it has used the information you provided.

M-Agent is the untiring analyst that's hard to hire and keep, always ready to learn more about your business, do more research, and provide better answers. But at some point, we want to use this to develop some strategic plans, so let's move on to strategy.
