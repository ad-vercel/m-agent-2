At this point, you have either [worked with M-Agent to build your marketing strategy or provided your own](/feature/develop-strategy). M-Agent is ready to get to work on your campaigns. 

M-Agent is familiar with the major digital marketing channels: SEO, SEM/PPC, social channels, influencer/PR, targeted advertising, including OTT, and events. If you use other marketing channels, we'll work with them. 

You can start by providing any campaign planning documents you already have, or describe some of your planned efforts, or ask M-Agent to spitball some ideas. In all cases, M-Agent will work to generate a concrete, actionable plan, broken down into individual campaigns, by channel, including budgets, creative ideas, audience targeting, and goals. M-Agent will help you break your planning down into a funnel structure, as appropriate. You can also tell M-Agent the outcomes you expect: increase awareness, subscribers/emails, on-site or social engagement, generate leads or MQLs, etc.

At this point, you can start to work on your creative. M-Agent can work with you on drafting copy and developing visual assets. Bring to it what you want: if you have stock images, or your own authored photos and video, you can share it with M-Agent. M-Agent will tag all your creative by campaign, audience, channel, and other themes, though of course you are welcome to modify its work, either granularly or with general feedback.

M-Agent can add initial budgeting and experimentation guidelines for your feedback, or you can do this yourself, either through general guidelines or more granularly. At the end of this process, your campaigns and creative are planned for the next period -- whether that's a week, a month, or a quarter, and you are ready to [put them into action](/feature/execute-campaigns).
